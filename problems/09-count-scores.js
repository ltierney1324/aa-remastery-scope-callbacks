/***********************************************************************
Write a function `countScores(people)` that takes in an array of score
objects (people) as its input. A score object has two key-value pairs:
the scorer (string) and a point value (number). `countScores(people)` should
return an object that has key-value pairs listing each person who scored as a key
and the sum of the total points for the game as their value.


Example 1:
let ppl = [{name: "Anthony", score: 10},
            {name: "Fred", score : 10},
            {name: "Anthony", score: -8},
            {name: "Winnie", score: 12}];

console.log(countScores(ppl)); //=> { Anthony: 2, Fred: 10, Winnie: 12 }

Example 2:
let peeps = [
  {name: "Anthony", score: 2},
  {name: "Winnie", score: 2},
  {name: "Fred", score: 2},
  {name: "Winnie", score: 2},
  {name: "Fred", score: 2},
  {name: "Anthony", score: 2},
  {name: "Winnie", score: 2}
];
console.log(countScores(peeps)); //=> { Anthony: 4, Fred: 4, Winnie: 6 }
***********************************************************************/

let countScores = function(people) {
  // Your code here

  const scoreTotal = {};

  for(let i=0; i<people.length; i++){

    let personObj = people[i];
    let person = personObj.name;
    let points = personObj.score;

    if(!scoreTotal[person]){
      scoreTotal[person]=0;
    }
    scoreTotal[person]+=points;
  }
  return scoreTotal;
}
